# iOS Weather App UI 
This project focuses on recreating the iOS Weather app's user interface using Xcode (Swift) with a specific emphasis on learning animation techniques. The UI includes animations such as rain, sun, moon, stars, and clouds. Additionally, some sunsets feature colors not present in the native app.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to serve as a learning platform for mastering animation techniques within Xcode and Swift development. By recreating the iOS Weather app interface, this project provides hands-on experience in implementing various animations, including rain, celestial bodies, and atmospheric effects.

## Features

- Faithful recreation of the iOS Weather app's user interface.
- Animations implemented using SpriteKit, leveraging SKScene, nodes, and particles for dynamic visual effects.
- Special rain effect designed to simulate raindrops hitting and splashing over informational boxes.
- Integration of informational boxes displaying meteorological data within the user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Xcode**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for iOS app development.
- **Swift**: Programming language used for implementing app logic and animations.
- **SpriteKit**: Framework utilized for creating and managing animations efficiently.
- **SKScene and Nodes**: Components utilized for organizing and controlling the visual elements of the animations.
- **Particles**: Used to enhance animations with dynamic and realistic effects, such as rain and atmospheric phenomena.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

## Usage

Upon launching the app, users will experience a faithful recreation of the iOS Weather app interface, complete with dynamic animations representing various weather conditions. Explore the interface to interact with different weather elements and view meteorological data displayed in informational boxes.
