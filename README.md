# iOS Weather App UI Clone

This project is a front-end codebase created to replicate the iOS Weather app interface, with a focus on learning animation techniques using Xcode (Swift). It includes animations such as rain, sun, moon, stars, and clouds. Additionally, some sunsets feature colors not found in the native app.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a hands-on learning experience for mastering animation concepts within Xcode and Swift. By recreating the iOS Weather app interface, emphasis was placed on understanding and implementing various animation techniques to achieve visually appealing effects.


## Features

- **Recreated iOS Weather app UI screen with animations.**
- **Animations implemented using SpriteKit, utilizing SKScene, nodes, and particles.**
- **Rain effect designed to simulate raindrops hitting and splashing over informational boxes.**
- **Informational boxes displaying weather data.**
- **Day and night alternation based on dark mode settings.**
- **Three interfaces for day mode and three for night mode, accessible via scrollable navigation from the home screen within the tab view's page-style layout.**

## Technologies Used

- **SpriteKit**: Utilized for creating and managing animations efficiently.
- **SKScene**: Used to organize and manage the visual elements of the animations.
- **Nodes and Particles**: Implemented to create various weather effects such as rain, sun, moon, stars, and clouds.
- **Dark Mode**: Utilized to alternate between day and night modes based on the system settings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

## Usage
